## Contributing

Please check out the list of issues if you'd like to contribute. 

Feel free to create issues (especially if you find bugs or have ideas for improvements) and submit PRs for them. They'll require a review before they're included in the main branch & subsequently the app.

Please run swiftlint on your code.
Please also include Unit Tests or UI Tests or both in your code.

If you want to fork the repo and use it for something similar but different, or just to learn more, please do - it'd be cool to hear about it, but no pressure.

I'd also love to work with a designer to refresh the assets, both in app and in the App Store.

## CI/CD

Each change to the main branch will result in Xcode Cloud running a testflight build - super helpful!

## History

It started life for me to:

- learn more about swiftui
- to trial xcode cloud
- to trial bitrise

It's grown into something a bit more than that. Full write up here: https://tinyurl.com/mrxucfxk
