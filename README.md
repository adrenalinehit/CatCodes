## Contributing

Please check out the list of issues. Feel free to create issues and submit PRs. They'll require a review before they're included in the main branch & subsequently the app.

Please run swiftlint on your code.
Please also include Unit Tests or UI Tests or both in your code.

I'd also love to work with a designer to refresh the assets, both in app and in the App Store.

## CD/CI

Each change to the main branch will result in XCode Cloud running a testflight build - super helpful!

## History

It started life for me to:

- learn more about swiftui
- to trial xcode cloud
- to trial bitrise

It's grown into something a bit more than that. Full write up here: https://tinyurl.com/mrxucfxk
