# Contributing

👍🎉 Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Http Codes! 🎉👍

_tl;dr;_

- Create an issue or pick one up (more detail the better)
- Fork
- Create a PR
- We'll review

If in doubt, please get in touch.

## ...a bit more

Please check out the list of issues if you'd like to contribute. 

Feel free to create issues (especially if you find bugs or have ideas for improvements) and submit PRs for them. They'll require a review before they're included in the main branch & subsequently the app.

Please run swiftlint on your code.

If you want to fork the repo and use it for something similar but different, or just to learn more, please do - it'd be cool to hear about it, but no pressure.

I'd also love to work with a designer to refresh the assets, both in app and in the App Store.

## What you'll need
- Xcode
- Unit testing / UI testing preferably, but don't worry if you haven't done this... we'll review the code anyway!
